<p>Context and overview</p>
<p>Key details</p>
<p>Policy prepared by: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cassandra Harada (Made To)</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p>Made To needs to gather and use certain information about individuals.</p>
<p>These can include customers, suppliers, business contacts, employees and other people the organisation has a relationship with or may need to contact.</p>
<p>This policy describes how this personal data will be collected, handled and stored to meet the company&rsquo;s data protection standards &mdash; and to comply with the law.</p>
<p>Why this policy exists</p>
<p>This data protection policy ensures Made To:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complies with data protection law and follow good practice</li>
    <li>Protects the rights of customers and partners</li>
    <li>Is open about how it stores and processes individuals&rsquo; data</li>
    <li>Protects itself from the risks of a data breach</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Data protection law</strong></span></p>
<p>The Japanese APPI regulation (adopted on May 30, 2017) describes how organisations &mdash; including Made To &mdash; must collect, handle and store personal information.</p>
<p>These rules apply regardless of whether data is stored electronically, on paper or on other materials.</p>
<p>To comply with the law, personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed unlawfully.</p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation is underpinned by eight important principles. These say that personal data must:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Be processed fairly and lawfully</li>
    <li>Be obtained only for specific, lawful purposes</li>
    <li>Be adequate, relevant and not excessive</li>
    <li>Be accurate and kept up to date</li>
    <li>Not be held for any longer than necessary</li>
    <li>Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects</li>
    <li>Be protected in appropriate ways</li>
    <li>Not be transferred outside of Japan, unless that country or territory also ensures an adequate level of protection</li>
</ol>
<p>People, risks and responsibilities</p>
<p>Policy scope</p>
<p>This policy applies to:</p>
<ul>

    <li>All contractors, suppliers and other people working on behalf of Made To</li>

    <li>&hellip;plus any other information relating directly or indirectly to individuals</li>
</ul>
<p>Data protection risks</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Breaches of confidentiality.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, information being given out inappropriately.</li>
    <li><strong>Failing to offer choice.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, all individuals should be free to choose how the company uses data relating to them.</li>
    <li><strong>Reputational damage.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, the company could suffer if hackers successfully gained access to sensitive data.</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules describe how and where data should be safely stored. Questions about storing data safely can be directed to the IT manager or data controller.</p>
<ul>
    <li>When data is <strong>stored on paper,&nbsp;</strong>it should be kept in a secure place where unauthorised people cannot see it.</li>

</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Data use</p>
<p>Personal data is of no value to Made To unless the business can make use of it. However, it is when personal data is accessed and used that it can be at the greatest risk of loss, corruption or theft:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When working with personal data, employees should ensure <strong>the screens of their computers are always locked&nbsp;</strong>when left unattended.</li>
    <li>Personal data <strong>should not be shared informally</strong>. In particular, it should never be sent by email, as this form of communication is not secure.</li>
    <li>Data must be <strong>encrypted before being transferred electronically</strong>. The IT manager can explain how to send data to authorised external contacts.</li>
    <li>Personal data should <strong>never be transferred outside of the Japanese Economic Area</strong>.</li>
    <li>Employees <strong>should not save copies of personal data to their own computers.&nbsp;</strong>Always access and update the central copy of any data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data accuracy</p>
<p>The law requires Made To to take reasonable steps to ensure data is kept accurate and up to date.</p>
<p>The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater the effort Made To should put into ensuring its accuracy.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of all employees who work with data to take reasonable steps to ensure it is kept as accurate and up to date as possible.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data will be held in <strong>as few places as necessary</strong>. Staff should not create any unnecessary additional data sets.</li>
    <li>Staff should <strong>take every opportunity to ensure data is updated.&nbsp;</strong>For instance, by confirming a customer&rsquo;s details when they call.</li>
    <li>Made To will make it <strong>easy for data subjects to update the information&nbsp;</strong>Made To holds about them. For instance, via the company website.</li>
    <li>Data should be <strong>updated as inaccuracies are discovered</strong>. For instance, if a customer can no longer be reached on their stored telephone number, it should be removed from the database.</li>
    <li>It is the marketing manager&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure <strong>marketing databases are checked against industry suppression files&nbsp;</strong>every six months.</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject access requests</p>
<p>All individuals who are the subject of personal data held by Made To are entitled to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ask <strong>what information&nbsp;</strong>the company holds about them and why.</li>
    <li>Ask <strong>how to gain access&nbsp;</strong>to it.</li>
    <li>Be informed <strong>how to keep it up to date.</strong></li>
    <li>Be informed how the company is <strong>meeting its data protection&nbsp;</strong></li>
    <li><strong>obligations</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>If an individual contacts the company requesting this information, this is called a subject access request.</p>
<p>Subject access requests from individuals should be made by email, addressed to the data controller at [email address]. The data controller can supply a standard request form, although individuals do not have to use this.</p>
<p>Individuals cannot be charged to honour a subject access request. The data controller will aim to provide the relevant data within 30 days.</p>
<p>The data controller will always verify the identity of anyone making a subject access request before handing over any information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Disclosing data for other reasons</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, the APPI allows personal data to be disclosed to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the data subject.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Made To will disclose requested data. However, the data controller will ensure the request is legitimate, seeking assistance from the board and from the company&rsquo;s legal advisers where necessary.</p>
<p>Providing information</p>
<p>Made To aims to ensure that individuals are aware that their data is being processed, and that they understand:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How the data is being used</li>
    <li>How to exercise their rights</li>
</ul>
<p>To these ends, the company has a privacy statement, setting out how data relating to individuals is used by the company.</p>
